## A discord bot that serves funny or inspirational Uncle Iroh quotes from the ever-popular Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series.

This simple/fun project could not have been accomplished without [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) or the help of [Brain Morrison's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx9EihBDfoJMncRWSZZoXg) on using DiscordGo to make a Discord bot in Go. If you are interested in building something similar, I highly recommend these resources.

## Things I learned
  * To use Discord's developer page to create a bot
  * To use Golang/DiscordGo to interact with Discord
  * To create a Discord bot that sends messages based on received input

## Usage
If you would like to copy this code and create/host the bot in your own server, you are free to do so. Please note that this line will require a key, generated by discord (my key was of course hidden for security reasons):
`botToken = key`

Ex. `botToken = "<your discord bot token here>"`

 * `!uncle wisdom` will prompt the bot to send an inspiring/philosophical Uncle Iroh quote
 * `!uncle haha` will prompt the bot to send a funny Uncle Iroh quote

Not many quotes were added, so feel free to add your favorite Uncle Iroh quotes!
