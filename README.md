## A discord bot that serves funny or inspirational Uncle Iroh quotes from the ever-popular Avatar: The Last Airbender animated series.

This simple/fun project could not have been accomplished without [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) or the help of [Brain Morrison's YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLx9EihBDfoJMncRWSZZoXg) on using DiscordGo to make a discord bot in Go. If you are interested in building something similar, I highly recommend these resources.

## Things I learned:
  * To use Discord's developer page to create a bot
  * To use Golang/DiscordGo to interact with Discord
  * To create a Discord bot that sends messages based on received input
